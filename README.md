#Solid Principles

single resp => class would have single respon if any changes affects same class

open closed => open for extension closed for modification

liskov substituion => subclass substitues/overrides the base class

interface segregation => divide the interface into smaller interfaces so that implementing class need not to be implement all methods in interface

dependency inversion => classes are not tightly coupled
